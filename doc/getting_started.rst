================

The Report Compiler HPV Information Centre data fetcher is a plugin for the `Report Compiler`_ library that extends the MySQL fetcher to support the inclusion of sources, notes and other info related to the fetched data. The plugin expects a particular database structure 
and it will be used in the HPV Information Centre project.

This project is being developed by the ICO/IARC Information Centre on HPV and Cancer and will be used in our report generation tasks.
